                <p>
                    Having a face, or rather a mascot, may be a strong tool in the realm of branding and marketing for communicating a brand’s ideals and values. 
                    A well-designed mascot draws the audience in, piques their interest, and forges a bond with them. 
                    It serves as a visual representation that captures the spirit of the brand and leaves customers with a strong impression. 
                    I’ve come to understand the value of including a mascot in my own brand, STE{A}M which stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math which is inspired by the whimsical spirit of the Duolingo mascot and the astounding intellect of crows.

                    The number one thing I learned from <a href="https://promineotech.com/">Promineo Tech’s</a> frontend bootcamp was that online resources are a google search away but I hope that this medium article can be a one-stop-shop for current and future programmers.

                    Today in my Science methods and practice class we did this exercise and it really stood out to me. 
                    There was a recurring theme in the pictures of scientists engaged in chemistry experiments. 
                    Many of my classmates seemed to find chemistry to be particularly fascinating, as evidenced by their selection of images of scientists working on various chemical processes. 
                    This emphasis on chemical experiments may reflect a common interest or even a recent shift in our scientific curriculum to emphasize this topic.

                <p>
                    As someone who was always interested in technology from a young age, I have always interacted with tech on a day to day basis. 
                    For the past couple of years I struggled with losing weight. 
                    I tried a lot of things from going to the gym for lifting weights and using the treadmill, dieting and running. 
                    I was never able to lose weight and keep the consistency. 
                    It wasn’t until the start of 2020 when my doctor asked if I had any health goals and I quickly responded with “getting 10,000 steps a day” without having a plan to achieve this. 
                    I got home and I remembered about an app back in 2016 known as “Pokemon Go” by Niantic labs.
